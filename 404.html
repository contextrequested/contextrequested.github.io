    404 — Context not found
  </h1>

  <p>
    You are standing in a place that the
    <em>Department of Contextual Studies (DoCS)</em> has officially classified
    as <strong>a "zone of derailed meanings"</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page you were looking for either does not exist, has been moved to a
    different contextual universe, or is currently in the
    <em>Archive of Unverified Claims of Meaning</em> for further investigation.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0" />

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem">Possible Causes According to DoCS Research</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The URL spontaneously transformed into a metaphorical concept.</li>
    <li>
      You have entered an area classified by the
      <em>Department for Contextual Risk Assessment</em>
      as "semiotically unstable."
    </li>
    <li>
      A redirect was planned but, for reasons that remain a mystery even to the
      <em>Center for Digital Esotericism</em>, was never implemented.
    </li>
    <li>
      The content in question may have been unpublished as part of the
      <strong>"Meaning Reduction 2030"</strong> program.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem">What you can do now</h2>

  <p>
    The researchers at the
    <em>Institute for Bureaucratic Phenomenology</em>
    recommend one of the following measures in such cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Return to the <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">Homepage</a>.</li>
    <li>Reconstruct the last known context.</li>
    <li>
      Ask the question that Dr. Elias Pending gives his students on every
      excursion into the semantic wilderness:
      <br />
      <strong>"What if the page never finds you?"</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Mumble a quiet, short "Okay..." and click on.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0" />

  <p>
    If you are convinced that this page should exist, please contact the
    <em>Chair of Applied Contextualism</em>. There, your case will be examined
    with the necessary academic rigor, documented, and then neatly filed on the
    "Unexplained Phenomena" shelf.

    Thank you for your understanding.<br />
    Please restore your own context to safety.
