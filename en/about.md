{:refdef: .text-justify}
The Department of Contextual Studies (DoCS) was founded in response to a simple, yet world-changing observation:
The modern world is full of things that nobody understands, and yet everyone simply accepts them.<br />
Where other institutions strive for clarity, we pursue what truly matters: context—especially when it's unnecessary.
Our work begins where meaning ends, and it ends where nobody asks why we're doing it at all.

## Our mission

{:refdef: .text-justify}
The DoCS is dedicated to the systematic overinterpretation of everyday phenomena.
Whether a tangled charging cable, a WhatsApp voice message at 03:12, or an e-scooter in existential imbalance:
We don’t merely observe – we contextualize until the context collapses under its own weight.

## FAQ

What does the Department for Contextual Studies actually do?
: The DoCS explores the hidden spaces of meaning in everyday life. If you've ever wondered why an object exists, why it exists now, or why it's looking at you in particular—we analyze it.

Are there any real research results?
: Of course. However, the results are usually "preliminary," "inconsistent," "paradoxical," or "not yet ready for humanity."

Why does the institute sometimes seem...overly serious?
: Because things only become truly funny when treated with full academic dignity.

Can I suggest topics?
: Yes. Any observation that is at least two seconds perplexing is considered a potential research subject.

How is the institute funded?
: Officially: through "structural funding."
: Unofficially: through the persistence of Dr. Pending and a very patient accounting department.

Why do your investigations take so long?
: Because context takes time. Or because Windows is currently updating.

## Manifesto

The Manifesto of the Department of Contextual Studies adopted in a windowless room, for good reason.

Everyday life is not banal.
: Every object carries a history, an intention, and occasionally a silent rebellion within it.

Context is the invisible medium of being.
: Without context, an object is merely form; with context, it is world.

Humans believe they understand—and are mistaken.
: The Institute honors this error, cultivates it, and protects it from unnecessary enlightenment.

We do not research because we must, but because we cannot do otherwise.
: 

Technology is not a tool, but a dialogue partner.
: A closed-off, sometimes passive-aggressive, yet still open to dialogue.

Every update is a spiritual process.
: The machine cleans itself. Humanity suffers. It's always been this way.

The institute is the counter-evidence to the claim that everything has already been researched.
: 

We take things seriously—because no one else does.
: 

 Restarting is the true beginning.
: For systems.
: And sometimes for people, too.
