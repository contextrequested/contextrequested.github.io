In this episode, we turn our attention to an object so unassuming that one would hardly suspect its profound significance: the ladder. Two stiles, a few rungs – a tool that has accompanied humankind for millennia, yet has undergone an astonishing, almost mythical transformation in modern Germany.

Because here, nothing that works remains unregulated. Over time, the ladder has been elevated to a high-tech artifact, surrounded by regulations, guidelines, and an aura of collective unease. A simple tool has become an object whose use resembles a ritual initiation – and whose very existence dissolves the boundary between everyday object and bureaucratic cult item.

With the emergence of the "ladder commissioner," a new figure enters the scene: half human, half collection of standards, armed with DIN EN 131 and a gaze that both inspects and judges. Companies capitulate to the realization that the ladder is no longer just a tool, but a destiny.

The episode delves further into the depths of the modern ladder cult: from the official "birth certificate" of each individual ladder to the dreaded ladder inspection log, a bureaucratic manuscript that would fit right into the catacombs of medieval councils. Inspection intervals, rung conditions, corner reinforcements—a work of administrative art whose rigor recalls Nietzsche's darker visions.

Those authorized to inspect a ladder become chosen ones. And, as with any initiation, some candidates fail at the very first encounter. For reasons of psychological stability, the training was eventually moved to virtual reality.

Thus, the ladder rises to become a symbol of state welfare, conceived so comprehensively that it ultimately prevents everything—even climbing itself. A utopia of perfect safety that simultaneously breeds its own opposite.

The ladder becomes a monument to a world that regulates everything to eliminate all risk, forgetting that work without upward mobility is hardly possible.

A triumph of intention – and its most complete failure.
